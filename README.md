![Cover Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/246a0b7e-933c-4be0-90aa-7718fd6c15be)

## Overview
ConTrackâ€”derived from Contract + Trackâ€”is designed to transform contract confusion into clarity. Contracts are the backbone of business, yet they remain complex, time-consuming, and difficult to manage. ConTrack leverages AI to streamline contract analysis, helping professionals understand agreements faster and mitigate risks effectively. Powered by IBM Granite and an Agentic RAG system, ConTrack extracts key terms, assigns obligations, scores compliance risks, and tracks critical deadlines. Users can instantly query contracts, receive concise summaries, and automate key workflows. With AI-driven automation, ConTrack ensures contracts work for youâ€”not against you.
